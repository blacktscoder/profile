I didn’t learn backend engineering by reading specs.

I learned by building things that broke.

## Early Systems Were Messy — And That’s Okay

My early projects weren’t elegant:
- APIs changed shape
- Database schemas evolved
- Assumptions failed

Each mistake taught me something concrete.

## Real Projects Teach Trade-offs

Tutorials show ideal paths.

Real projects force trade-offs:
- Speed vs correctness
- Flexibility vs simplicity
- Abstraction vs clarity

That’s where real learning happens.

## Building Is the Shortcut

If there’s one lesson I trust:
Build real things. Let them fail. Fix them.

That’s how backend engineers grow.
