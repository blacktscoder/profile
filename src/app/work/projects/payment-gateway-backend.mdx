Payments change how you think about backend engineering.

This wasn’t just another API. Every request represented real money, real users, and real consequences if something went wrong.

## Everything Becomes About Trust

The first thing I learned is that payment systems are not about features — they’re about **trust**.

- Requests must be idempotent
- Errors must be explicit
- State transitions must be predictable

You can’t afford “almost correct.”

## Failure Is the Default Case

Networks fail. Clients retry. Messages duplicate.

Instead of fighting this, I designed the system to **expect failure**:
- Safe retries
- Transaction boundaries
- Clear audit trails

Once failure became a first-class concept, the system became calmer.

## The Backend Is the Product

In payment systems, users never see the backend — but they *feel* it.

When payments work silently, you’ve done your job.

That mindset changed how I design every backend system since.
