Working on a banking-style application forced me to confront a hard truth:

Most complexity is self-inflicted.

## Clear Boundaries Matter

The most important decision wasn’t the tech stack — it was defining boundaries:
- Authentication logic lived in one place
- Business rules lived somewhere else
- Data access stayed boring and predictable

Once boundaries were clear, everything became easier to reason about.

## Predictability > Cleverness

I resisted the urge to over-engineer:
- No magic abstractions
- No hidden side effects
- No clever shortcuts

When money and accounts are involved, boring is a feature.

## Calm Systems Age Better

A backend that feels calm to work in is usually a backend that ages well.

That’s the standard I aim for now.
