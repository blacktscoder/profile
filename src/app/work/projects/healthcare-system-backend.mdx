Healthcare systems don’t get the luxury of being “good enough.”

They’re used by people under stress, pressure, and urgency.

## Reliability Is a Form of Empathy

Downtime isn’t just inconvenient — it can block care.

That changed how I approached:
- Error handling
- Validation
- Edge cases

The backend had to be dependable even when inputs weren’t perfect.

## Clean APIs Reduce Cognitive Load

Clear APIs help frontend teams move faster — but more importantly, they reduce mistakes.

Less ambiguity means fewer errors reaching users.

## The Backend Has Human Impact

This project reminded me that backend engineering isn’t abstract.

It shows up in real lives.
