Health data forces you to slow down.

This project wasn’t about speed or features — it was about **responsibility**.

## Data Sensitivity Changes Everything

When dealing with health-related data:
- Access control must be explicit
- Data exposure must be minimal
- Defaults must be safe

I learned to design APIs that expose *only* what’s necessary — nothing more.

## Serverless Taught Me Discipline

Using serverless architecture forced me to:
- Keep functions small
- Avoid unnecessary state
- Think carefully about data boundaries

Constraints made the system cleaner.

## Engineering Is About People

Behind every data point is a real person.

That realization stays with you.
