GraphQL is powerful.  
REST is simple.  

Neither is automatically better.

## When REST Works Best

REST shines when:
- Data access patterns are predictable
- Caching is critical
- Simplicity matters more than flexibility

REST endpoints are easier to debug, cache, and secure—especially at scale.

## Where GraphQL Excels

GraphQL is ideal when:
- Clients need flexible data shapes
- You support multiple frontends
- Over-fetching becomes a real problem

But flexibility comes with responsibility:
- Query complexity limits
- Depth limiting
- Careful resolver design

## The Real Cost: Operational Complexity

GraphQL introduces:
- New performance risks
- Harder caching
- More responsibility on backend teams

If your team isn’t ready to manage that complexity, REST may be the better choice.

## Conclusion

Choose tools based on **constraints**, not popularity.

Good backend engineering is about trade-offs—not trends.
