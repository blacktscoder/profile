If your API request takes more than a second, it probably doesn’t belong there.

## What Should Be Async?

Move these out of request cycles:
- Emails
- Notifications
- File processing
- Data synchronization
- Heavy computations

Users don’t need to wait for everything.

## Queues Improve Reliability

Queues provide:
- Retry mechanisms
- Failure isolation
- Traffic smoothing

They turn spikes into manageable workloads.

## Event-Driven Thinking

Instead of asking “what should this endpoint do?”  
Ask “what events should this action trigger?”

This mindset leads to cleaner systems and better scalability.

## Final Thought

Fast APIs are rarely fast because of raw speed.  
They’re fast because they **do less**.
