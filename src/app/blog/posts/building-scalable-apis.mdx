Most APIs work perfectly—until users show up.

The real challenge in backend engineering isn’t getting an API to work.  
It’s keeping it **fast, reliable, and predictable** as traffic, data, and complexity grow.

## Start With Contracts, Not Code

Before performance tuning or caching, define clear API contracts:
- Stable request/response shapes
- Explicit error formats
- Versioning strategy from day one

Breaking changes are far more expensive than writing slightly more code early on.

## Design for Failure Early

Assume:
- Databases will slow down
- Third-party APIs will fail
- Clients will send bad data

Good APIs fail **gracefully**:
- Timeouts
- Retries with backoff
- Clear error messages

## Scaling Is Mostly About Reducing Work

Scaling is rarely about adding servers. It’s about:
- Avoiding unnecessary queries
- Caching aggressively (but intentionally)
- Moving heavy tasks to background jobs

The fastest request is the one you never make.

## Final Thoughts

APIs that scale are boring by design.  
Predictable. Defensive. Well-documented.

That’s a feature—not a weakness.
