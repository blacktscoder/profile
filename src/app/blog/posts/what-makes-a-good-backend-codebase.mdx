A good backend codebase isn’t perfect—it’s understandable.

## Clear Project Structure

I look for:
- Logical folder organization
- Clear separation of concerns
- Consistent naming conventions

If structure is unclear, everything else suffers.

## Strong Boundaries

Good systems define:
- Where business logic lives
- Where data access happens
- Where side effects occur

Boundaries prevent chaos.

## Tests That Matter

Not 100% coverage—**meaningful coverage**:
- Critical business logic
- Edge cases
- Failure scenarios

Tests are about confidence, not metrics.

## Final Thoughts

A great backend codebase feels calm to work in.  
It doesn’t surprise you.  
It doesn’t fight you.

That’s the goal.
