Most backend failures don’t happen in clean environments.

They happen at 2 AM, under load, with partial logs and incomplete context.

## Favor Explicitness Over Cleverness

Readable code beats clever abstractions:
- Clear function names
- Predictable data flow
- Minimal hidden side effects

Future you (or your teammate) will thank you.

## Logging Is Not an Afterthought

Logs should answer:
- What happened?
- Why did it happen?
- What data was involved?

Log intent—not just errors.

## Embrace Observability Early

Metrics, tracing, and structured logs aren’t “enterprise-only” tools.  
They are survival tools for growing systems.

## Simple Systems Fail Better

Complex systems fail in complex ways.  
Simple systems fail loudly—and recover faster.

Design for clarity, not elegance.
